A minimalistic webapp plugin for sbt

To build this code, get and install SBT from 
    https://github.com/sbt/sbt

Get and install this plugin before building:
    https://github.com/ritschwumm/xsbt-classpath

Build and publish the plugin:
    git clone git@github.com:ritschwumm/xsbt-webapp.git
    cd xsbt-webapp
    sbt publish-local
    
Add the plugin to your project in project/plugins.sbt:
    addSbtPlugin("de.djini" % "xsbt-webapp" % "0.5.0")
    
Include the plugin in you project's build.sbt:

    webappSettings
    
Run the webapp task to get a web application directory.

If you need a war file include xsbt-zipper from
     https://github.com/ritschwumm/xsbt-classpath
and add something like this to your build.sbt:

    // webapp::zipper
    inTask(webappBuild)(zipperSettings ++ Seq(
        zipperFiles     := selectSubpaths(webappBuild.value, AllPassFilter).toSeq,
        zipperPrefix    := None,
        zipperExtension := ".war"
    ))
    
    // alias for webapp::zipper
    TaskKey[File]("war")    := (zipperBuild in webappBuild).value

Then run the war task to get a zipped up war file.
